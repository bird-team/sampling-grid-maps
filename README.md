# Notice

This repository has been deprecated. It contains code and data that were initially used to produce maps for surveyor sheets for the [Atlas of the Birds of Brisbane](https://brisbanebirds.com). However, this functionality has since been merged into the [main atlas repository](https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas) to reduce the number and complexity of steps involved when updating the atlas with new eBird data (per [bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas@7855b62]( https://github.com/bird-team/brisbane-bird-atlas/commit/7855b6235a49d7c952a1da2594f9f33171e63d71)). This repository remains online to serve as a reference. It is no longer used at all in the atlas workflow and is no longer supported.
