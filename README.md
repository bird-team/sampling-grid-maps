# Sampling grid maps

This repository contains the code and data for producing maps for the sampling sheets used by the [Atlas of the Birds of Brisbane](https://brisbanebirds.com).

## Usage

To create the maps locally, execute the command `make maps` in the terminal and they will appear in the _exports_ directory. The appearance of these maps can be customized by changing the parameters in the _data/parameters/parameters.yml_ file. Finally, locally produced maps can be uploaded to the repository using the command `make push_maps`. For convenience, the command `make all` can be used to create the maps and upload them to the repository.
